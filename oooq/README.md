oooq wrapper
============

I use [TripleO Quickstart](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-quickstart)
and this is just a set of wrapper scripts I use with it. 

I am focussed on how TripleO deploys Ceph and running OSDs on compute
nodes so this environment helps me quickly get a two-node HCI
overcloud.
